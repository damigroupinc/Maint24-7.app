Description Version 1.0
***********************
Maint247 for property owners and tentants to make their service orders 24/7

The App’s main purpose is to manage the properties that the landlord has rented and allow the landlord to 
have a good maintenance and a good history of his lease period.

This allows the homeowner to know everything that is happening to their real estate in real time, 
allowing them to manage their real estate that will be available in their App so they can consult and 
study which strategic paths to take when making decisions and strategic planning.

The great proposal of the App is that the property owner will have in real time the control of 
all demands opened by the tenant and the movement made in his properties. 
He will have on hands 24/7 the service online and on cell phone.

The App has a dashboard page where the user can manage all their units through indicators of quality, 
capacity and productivity as their maintenance staff and landlords. 
This will allow an accurate analysis of results, allowing a better strategic planning.

When the tenant has any needs in the property, he will open a work order  that order  
will reach the owner of the property who will get his team to answer the order, 
selecting a service provider to solve the problem in Open order. 
By fixing the problem, the tenant will close the work order and evaluate work and service delivered.

Open work orders will have a history containing records, such as complaints, compliments, problem detail records, and 
any other communication that needs to be recorded and saved as history.

The landlord will have access to all open orders for that property. 
In addition to making the necessary records. The landlord will be able to use the indices to check which part is being the most problematic, 
thus allowing the landlord to better manage the use, care and charges to the property owner.

The App has two functions that are move-in and move-out, important for both the resident or the owner of the property. 
These functions, once performed, do not allow to delete or change remaining in the system for consultation.
At the end of the leasing, upon release of the unit, the system will email the history along with the move-in 
and move-out to the landlord and the tenant  to record for any eventuality.
